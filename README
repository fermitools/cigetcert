                             PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
                             ===================

cigetcert gets an X.509 certificate from a SAML 2.0 Service Provider
(SP) such as CILogon using the Enhanced Client and Proxy (ECP)
profile. Optionally it can also get a grid proxy certificate and/or
transfer the proxy to MyProxy. It was developed for the Fermilab
Distributed Computing Access with Federated Identities (DCAFI) project
but is intended to be usable by other projects.
