.TH cigetcert 1
.SH NAME
cigetcert \- get an X.509 certificate using SAML ECP and store proxies

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cigetcert
.RI [ OPTION ]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cigetcert
gets an X.509 certificate from a SAML 2.0 Service Provider such as
CILogon, using the Enhanced Client or Proxy (ECP) profile.
It can authenticate using either kerberos or password authentication.
It stores either the certificate or a proxy certificate on the local
filesystem, and also optionally stores a proxy in a MyProxy server.
.PP
When getting a certificate, the only required option is
.I \-\-institution
(or
.IR \-i ).
The option may come from a server rather than the command line when
.I \-\-server
(or
.IR \-s )
is used.
.PP
If an existing certificate has a minimum number of hours of validity
remaining,
.B
cigetcert
will reuse the certificate rather than getting a new one.  Details are
under the
.I \-\-minhours
option below.

.SH OPTIONS
.PP

.B \-\-version
Show the program's version number and exit.
.TP
.BR \-h , \ \-\-help
Show a help message and exit.
.TP
.BR \-v , \ \-\-verbose
Write detailed progress reports to stdout instead of the default
concise reports.
.TP

Write debug output to stdout.  Implies
.IR \-v .
Be aware that this writes a lot of output.
.TP
.BR \-q , \ \-\-quiet
Do not print anything, not the concise progress reports and not even
error messages.
.TP
.BR \-s\ HostOrURL , \ \-\-optserver=HostOrURL
The server host name or URL with default cigetcert options.  If it is
just a host name, the URL read is
.RS
.RS
https://hostname/cigetcertopts.txt
.RE
otherwise the whole URL is read.
See also CIGETCERTOPTS in the ENVIRONMENT section below.

.BR \-i\ Name , \ \-\-institution\ Name
The name of the institution that will provide the authentication from
its Identity Provider (IdP).  This is required.
.TP
.B \-\-listinstitutions
Show the current list of available instituions and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-idplisturl=URL
The URL that contains a file mapping IdP URLs to institution names,
one per line.  If the institution name ends with "(Kerberos)" then
that parenthetical ending is removed and that IdP is used when
authenticating with kerberos.  The URL may begin with https:// or
file://.  The default URL is
.RS
.RS
https://cilogon.org/include/ecpidps.txt
.RE
.RE

https://ecp.cilogon.org/secure/getcert
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-cafile=file
The path to a file containing a bundle of Certifying Authority (CA)
certificates.
These will be used to verify the validity of https connections.
The default is
.RS
.RS
/etc/pki/tls/cert.pem
.RE
or, if that doesn't exist, the default is
.RS
/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-capath=path
The path to a directory containing Certifying Authority (CA) certificates.
These will be used in addition to the

.RS
.RS
/etc/grid-security/certificates
.RE
.RE
.TP
.BR \-k , \ \-\-kerberos
Prefer kerberos authentication with the IdP if a kerberos ticket
is available.  When not in combination with the
.I \-\-noprompt
option, if kerberos authentication fails then password authentication
will be attempted.  This option is the default if the IdP of the 
chosen institution has a URL marked with "(Kerberos)" in the
idplisturl (unless the \-\-nokerberos option is used).
.TP
.BR \ \-\-nokerberos
Do not attempt to use kerberos authentication.  If multiple 
.I \-\-kerberos
and
.I \-\-nokerberos
options are given, the last one specified applies.
.TP
.BR \-n , \ \-\-noprompt
Do not prompt for a password.  Implies
.IR \-\-kerberos .
.TP
.BR \-p\ str , \ \-\-promptstr=str
The string used when prompting for a password.  The default is
.RS
.RS
Password for %username@%realm

.I \-\-username
option and %realm is the realm value that the IdP supplies.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-u\ str , \ \-\-username=str
The string used as the username when authenticating with the IdP.
The default is the current user name.
.TP
.BR \-o\ path , \ \-\-out=path
The path of the file used to store the certificate/key chain or proxy
certificate/key chain on the local machine.  The default is
$X509_USER_PROXY if it is set, or otherwise the default is
.RS
.RS
/tmp/x509up_%uid
.RE
where %uid is the current effective user id.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-reuseonly
Only check to see if an existing certificate or proxy in the path
of the
.I \-\-out
option can be reused (according to the algorithm shown in
.I \-\-minhours
below); do not get a new certificate if the old one cannot be reused.
This defaults to true if a file at the
.I \-\-out
path already exists and is read-only, otherwise the default is false.
.TP
.B \-\-noreuseonly
Negate the 
.I \-\-reuseonly
option; get a certificate if an old one cannot be reused.  If multiple 
.I \-\-reuseonly
and
.I \-\-noreuseonly
options are given, the last one specified applies.
.TP
.B \-\-minhours=num
The minimum number of hours remaining before the existing local
certificate chain expires in order to reuse it instead of making a
new one.
This feature is intended to reduce load on the servers.
.I num
may be a floating point number to specify fractions of hours for this
option (similarly for all other *hours options).
The default is 1.
Also, if myproxy options (below) are set, in order to reuse a proxy it
has to already exist in the myproxy server and have a minimum number
of hours remaining that is at least the greater of %minhours or
.RS
.RS
(%hours - %proxyhours - %minhours)
.RE
where the '%' names are the values of the corresponding options.
Finally, if the
.I \-\-myproxyretrievers
option is set, that also must match with the value stored with the
proxy on MyProxy.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-hours=num
The number of hours on the certificate created by the SP.
The maximum is ordinarly 277.7777 (a million seconds), unless
.I \-\-myproxyserver
is set; then the maximum is 10000 hours (a little over 13 months).
If a fractional number of hours is requested, the actual certificate
will be rounded up to the next whole hour but there will be a proxy
generated with the requested time.
The default is 168 (a week).
.TP
.B \-\-proxyhours=num
The number of hours on a proxy certificate stored on the local filesystem.
The maximum is 277.7777 (a million seconds).
The default is the value of
.IR \-\-hours ,
unless it is greater than 277.7777; then the default is 168 (a week).
Implies
.I \-\-proxy
if not equal to the value of
.IR \-\-hours .
.TP
.B \-\-proxy
Store a proxy certificate/key chain on the local filesystem instead of
the original certificate/key chain created by the SP.  Throw away the
key of the original certificate.  This option is implied when the
value of
.I \-\-hours
does not match the value of
.IR \-\-proxyhours .
It is also implied when 
.B \-\-hours
is not a whole number, because the original certificate cannot be
fractions of an hour.
.TP
.B \-\-myproxyserver=Host
Host name of a MyProxy server for storing a proxy certificate/key chain.
The duration of that proxy will be the same as the original certificate,
which is the value of
.IR \-\-hours .
.TP
.B \-\-myproxyusername=str
The username of the proxy stored in the MyProxy server.
The default is %certsubject which gets replaced with the base certificate
subject DN (after stripping off up to 5 proxy levels).
The string may contain %username which is replaced with the value of
.IR \-\-username .
.TP
.B \-\-myproxyretrievers=expr
A regular expression of certificate subject DNs that will be
permitted to fetch a proxy from the MyProxy server for the
username matching the value of 
.IR \-\-myproxyusername .
.TP
.B \-\-myproxyhours=num
The maximum number of hours of a proxy that may be fetched from 
MyProxy.
The maximum is 277.7777.
The default is the value of 
.IR \-\-proxyhours.
